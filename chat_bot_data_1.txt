Main article: Ben 10 (2005 TV series)
The series centers on Ben Tennyson, a 10-year-old boy on a summer vacation road trip with his cousin Gwen and their grandfather Max, who is later revealed to be a member of a secret intergalactic organization called the Plumbers. On their first night camping in their grandfather's RV, nicknamed the Rust Bucket, Ben finds a mysterious watch-like alien device that attaches itself upon his wrist, giving him the ability to transform into several (initially ten but later more) alien life-forms, each with special abilities. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various enemies, ranging from aliens such as intergalactic warlord Vilgax, bounty hunter duo Sixsix and Kraab, and Ectonurite high king Zs'skayr, criminals such as 11-year-old energy absorbing delinquent Kevin Levin, mad scientist Doctor Animo, and the mysterious paramilitary organization the Forever Knights, to supernatural entities such as interdimensional sorcerer Hex and his niece Charmcaster, and clown mastermind Zombozo and his Circus Freak Trio.

Ben has removed the Omnitrix and returned to living a normal life, but he is forced to use it again to save his grandfather Max, who has been abducted by a xenophobic alien species called the Highbreeds as part of a plot to rid the Earth of human beings.

Ben is joined by Gwen and former enemy Kevin Levin as they fight the Highbreed's universal extermination plan.

The official Twitter feed of Cartoon Network PR[3] confirmed a rebooted series that would return to following the adventures of Ben, Gwen, and Max Tennyson and feature new alien forms. In mid-June 2016, Cartoon Network released the first poster for the series, in which ten of the most popular aliens from the franchise were featured. The series would premiere on international Cartoon Networks beginning in October 2016, with Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East & African versions, and continuing into 2017 with the North and Latin American versions.[4][5]

The world premiere was on Cartoon Network (Australia and New Zealand), airing on October 1, 2016.[6] The U.K network premiered the series on October 8, 2016.[7] The German Cartoon Network premiered the first two episodes on October 10, 2016.[8] The series premiered in the United States on April 10, 2017.

Future
On June 14, 2011, producer Joel Silver announced that he, along with Warner Bros. and Dark Castle Entertainment, would be working on a film version of Ben 10.[9] In January 2012, Albert Torres was announced as screenwriter.[10] In February 2013, Ryan Engle was announced to work on Torres' script. Andrew Rona, Steve Richards, and Joel Silver were producers. Alex Heineman and Sarah Meyer were executive producers.[11] As of 2023, no update has been given about the film.

In 2013, in response to fan questioning about rumors of a Gwen 10 spin-off series, Man of Action confirmed they were actively working with a Japanese anime company to develop a series that would "just follow Gwen without any Ben" as they attend college, retaining her boyfriend Kevin Levin as a supporting character, citing the character's greater popularity in Asia compared to Ben as the reason for the solo series entering development.[12] Despite this, no update on the Gwen 10 spin-off has been given as of 2023.

According to Duncan Rouleau, Cartoon Network has plans they are working on right now. He hoped that there would be some announcements by the end of 2021,[13][14] but as of 2023, no announcement has been made so far. The crew was developing many options; the changing fields of platforms from cable to streaming, the consolidation of Warner Bros. franchises, and a "thousand other factors" determined where, how, and when this iteration will finally settle.[15]
